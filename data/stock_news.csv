AUTO|F|2017-07-19 08:53:37|cnbc.com|https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/19/jpmorgan-asset-management-us-dollar-will-rebound-in-second-half-of-2017.html|The US dollar will rebound in the second half of 2017, says JPMorgan|The current weakness in the U.S. dollar may be short lived, as a pick-up in inflation and expected rate hikes by the Federal Reserve will support the greenback in the coming months, JPMorgan Asset Management said Wednesday. "We're thinking that the dollar will actually rebound in the second half, and this is mainly as the markets re-price in interest rates hike. We're of the view that inflation will actually be picking up in the U.S. and currently, markets have only priced in one rate hike now till end-2018," Jasslyn Yeo, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC's "Street Signs." "So, we think (markets) are going to do a bit of re-pricing and that will support a bit of a rebound in the dollar," she added. The U.S. dollar tumbled to a 10-month low on Tuesday after the Republican health-care bill aimed at replacing Obamacare failed to get enough backing to proceed to a debate. Some market observers have said that a weaker dollar can help to boost earnings of S&P 500 companies and eventually justify their high valuations. But Yeo said equity markets outside the U.S., such as Europe and Japan, have more upside potential. Yeo noted that margins in Europe are starting to improve and that could translate into stronger earnings growth, while Japan is likely to benefit from a weaker yen versus the U.S. dollar. "We still like certain spots in the U.S. market. Currently we still favor U.S. banks, which we like in terms of rate hike expectations, bond yields moving higher as well as the promise for financial deregulation in the banking system," she said. "Purely from a valuation play we think that U.S. valuations are more challenging at the moment and investors should be looking to diversify out of the U.S. to other various markets."

DAL on Monday lowered its performance estimates for the first half of 2017, and now its stock is down 3.41% to $48.40 per share through early afternoon trading. Stocks of other big U.S. airlines have also experienced some turbulence on the back of the Delta news, high oil prices , and fallout from President Donald Trump's travel ban.Southwest Airlines Co. LUV stock is down 2.36% to $57.46 per share in Monday trading. American Airlines Group, Inc. AAL stock is down 4.46% to $44.73 per share. United Continental Holdings, Inc. UAL stock is down 4.18% to $72.46 per share. And US Global Jets ETF JETS stock is down 2.08% to $28.71 per share.Delta's 8-K filing identified both lower unit revenue and higher costs as reasons for its lowered first half of 2017 expectations. The Atlanta-based airline predicted its Revenue per Available Seat Mile or unit revenue, which is calculated by dividing an airline's total revenue by its total available seat miles, will be flat in the first quarter of 2017. This came after Delta predicted in January its unit revenue would increase by 2%.Rising oil prices also contributed to Delta's lowered expectations. "Market fuel prices are tracking up about 55% for the quarter, which is expected to be the greatest year-on-year increase in 2017," the filing noted .This downturn comes only a few weeks after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A bought an eye-popping 43.2 million shares of Southwest Airlines in the fourth quarter.Berkshire's new position in the low-cost carrier is valued at $2.2 billion. Buffett's company also invested heavily in American Airlines, Delta and United, which signaled a shift in Buffett's decades-long stance that airlines were money-losers.Updated Travel BanTrump and the White House announced Monday morning an updated, less-drastic version of its travel ban. The new executive order removed Iraq from the list, leaving Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Iraq was removed after political pressure mounted, a great deal of which hung on the continuation of a joint U.S. and Iraqi effort to fight the Islamic State.The revamped executive order now exempts travelers holding valid visas or green cards as of Jan. 27, the date the initial ban went into effect. The new order also treats Syrian refugees, which were banned outright in the first order, the same as those from other countries.Trump's updated travel ban will not be put into action until March 16. The delay was implemented in order to address potential legal concerns.The new travel ban also comes after reports showed that the number of people visiting the U.S. from foreign countries has decreased significantly. New York City could see foreign travel decrease by over 2% in 2017, which would be the first drop in eight years. Other major U.S. cities have predicted a similar drop.A decrease in International travel could create $7.4 billion in lost revenue .Airline Update: More Economy FlightsUnited recently announced it will offer more domestic routes and budget-friendly flights . The airline will add summer flights from five of its hubs to 13 non-major cities. United will also increase flights on some existing routes and upgrade some seasonal routes into year-round options.United will add new flights from its biggest hub, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, to places such as Spokane, Wash. Airline hubs help save airlines money and offer passengers better routes to their selected destinations. The four major U.S. airlines all have nearly 10 different hubs.The added domestic routes came after United and American Airlines introduced brand new economy-class options . United and American Airlines plan to slowly roll out these new cheaper flights to most domestic destinations and eventually shorter trips to Latin America and the CaribbeanUnited and American Airlines made the move towards more economy-fares after Delta broke into the market last year. United plans to expand its new economy pricing beyond Minneapolis to its entire domestic roster, as the company fights to add more budget-minded consumers.The fight to offer more economical flights comes as low-cost airlines Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE and Frontier Airlines Inc. have gained traction. Southwest is still the most popular budget-friendly airline.8 Stocks with Huge Profit Potential                                                              Just released: Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

AUTO|RACE|2016-11-13 08:53:37|nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-auto-investors-are-worried-about-the-united-states-cm708299|Why Auto Investors Are Worried About the United States|Shares of the Detroit automakers have had a tough ride in 2016. Year to date, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) shares are down almost 13%, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles '(NYSE: FCAU) are down nearly 17%.General Motors '(NYSE: GM) shares are about flat for the year, but only because a sharp rally on Thursday and Friday erased its losses. Through this past Wednesday, GM's stock was down about 9% since the beginning of 2016.It doesn't seem fair. All three have reported strong profits in recent quarters. But investors have been worried about the U.S. new-car market, which accounts for the bulk of Detroit's profits -- and which is showing signs of slowing down.Strong truck and SUV sales have generated fat profits for Detroit over the last few years. Image source: Ford Motor Company.North America is extremely important to Detroit's bottom linesGM, Ford, and FCA are all global companies with huge operations around the world. But all three, more so than most of their global rivals, are still very dependent on profits in North America, most of which come from the United States.Data sources: the automakers' earnings reports. Chart shows adjusted pre-tax profits in North America (blue) as a percentage of overall pre-tax profits (blue plus green) for 2016 through Sept. 30. FCA's results have been converted from euros to U.S. dollars at a rate of 1 euro = $1.09.That makes the state of the U.S. new-car market very important to investors in the Detroit automakers. And as I said, there are growing signs that it may be past its cyclical peak.As U.S. sales go, so do Detroit's profitsAuto sales are cyclical. Demand for new cars and trucks is closely correlated with consumer confidence, for reasons that are probably obvious: People and businesses hold off on buying new vehicles when they're concerned that their earnings are going to be squeezed.The pace of auto sales is tracked using a calculated statistic called the "SAAR," for "seasonally adjusted annualized rate." If we say that the SAAR for October 2016 was 17.65 million, it means that if the pace of auto sales we saw in October were maintained for a full calendar year, 17.65 million vehicles would be sold that year.There are several different calculations of SAAR. The most important one for our purposes is the one that shows the pace of U.S. sales of "light vehicles," meaning cars, pickups, and SUVs. This chart shows the SAAR for the past three years.The pace of sales can vary considerably from month to month, but the trend isn't too hard to see: While it's still very strong by historical standards, the pace of light-vehicle sales in the U.S. peaked late in 2015 and has fallen off since.This longer-term chart, showing mostly SAAR figures all the way back to the beginning of 2000, might make the picture more clear.U.S. light-vehicle sales plateaued from 2000 through 2006, fell off a cliff in 2008, and didn't really recover to pre-recession levels until 2014. They went a little higher in 2015 and have slipped back a bit in 2016.What does it mean if the auto sales cycle is past its peak?As last decade's data shows, if the economy is reasonably strong, auto sales can stay at a plateau for several years. That might be how things play out this time. But there are signs that automakers are starting to scrounge for sales growth by boosting their incentives. That's not an encouraging sign for investors, as rising incentives tend to eat into profit margins.There are other signs. Just in the past few weeks, both Ford and GM have announced production cuts . They were modest ones, but production cuts of any kind aren't something we'd expect to see in a growing market.For long-term investors, there's no reason to panic: A cyclical sales decline is normal and inevitable. But it's worth keeping in mind that as sales in North America taper off, profits at the Detroit automakers are likely to come under pressure for a while.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Ford Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

AUTO|RACE|2016-11-12 05:37:27|nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/donald-trump-and-the-stock-market-did-you-miss-these-moves-cm708221|Donald Trump and the Stock Market: Did You Miss These Moves?|I've decided that the markets are similar to small children: Just when you believe you have them figured out, they zig when you anticipate a zag. Donald Trump shocked the nation with his surprise victory earlier this week, and Dow futures abruptly dropped roughly 850 points -- more than the drop after the events of 9/11. Then, something crazy happened. That decline abruptly reversed in the morning hours, and throughout the week, enabling the Dow to post its largest weekly gain since 2011. Raise your hand if you saw that coming? Go ahead; I'll wait.While there's a huge amount of uncertainty attached to Trump's upcoming presidency, we should all remember to avoid knee-jerk reactions, because you just never know when the market will zig instead of zag. Sticking with the Trump theme, here are some companies making big headlines or big moves this week.Fiat Chrysler's Trump cardThe auto industry can't catch a break this year, with Brexit throwing a curveball in Europe and sales peaking in the U.S. market. Now, Trump has mentioned a couple of strings he might yank that could complicate things for multiple major automakers.Trump mentioned potentially adding tariffs to vehicles exported from Mexico to the U.S., which would make it more expensive for Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors to produce small cars in Mexico and bring them to the states. Some estimate (take it with a grain of salt) that the additional cost could reach $5,000 per vehicle. Despite that negative prediction, automakers largely rebounded this week for one reason: likely relaxed emissions standards. And that left Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) in the dust, watching other automakers surge higher.TSLA Price data by YCharts .The story is simple: Trump plans to complete a comprehensive review of all federal regulations, especially the fuel economy and emissions standards. The belief is that the emissions standards, set to require fleets to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, will be relaxed significantly.Tesla's Model S. Image source: Tesla Motors.That would hinder demand for electric vehicles, which Tesla solely focuses on, and enable Detroit automakers to focus more on larger vehicles. "We cannot see this in a positive light for Tesla," said Morgan Stanley 's Adam Jonas, speaking in regards to the election results, according to Barron's . "An environment that moves away from incentivizing electric vehicles is clearly adverse to the story."That's also why Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) jumped the highest this week. It benefited the most since it was drastically behind the industry in terms of developing electric vehicles or hybrids and still heavily relies on Jeep and Ram Truck for profits.Defense and industrials stocks surgeI'll refrain from quoting any of Trump's speeches, but it's pretty clear if you heard him over the course of his campaign that defense companies are poised to benefit -- and that was certainly reflected in the markets this week.RTN Price data by YCharts .Morningstar even took a broad brush to its price targets for defense companies: "Our new fair value estimates are as follows: General Dynamics $168 (from $155), Raytheon $151 ($144), L-3 Communications $145 ($138), Northrop Grumman $208 ($192), Lockheed Martin $224 ($221), and Boeing $151 ($145)."Image source: Getty Images.Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) had an even better week as it secured a contract from the U.S. Air Force to provide vehicles and support equipment for Lot 10 Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammer, or MALD-J. The contract is valued at just over $76 million.In terms of industrials, Trump's victory was a huge boon for U.S. Concrete (NASDAQ: USCR) ; its stock price jumped 17% for the week. It's not difficult to understand why, either. U.S. Concrete generates almost 60% of its revenues from selling products in the commercial and industrial construction business, and another 16% from street, highway, and other public projects.Both of those segments stand to benefit from Trump's promised infrastructure spending, especially the latter. Beyond that, it's even more encouraging for investors of U.S. Concrete because the company operates most of its business in critical markets such as New York; New Jersey; Washington, D.C.; Northern California; and Texas.Even better yet, the company's business revolves around selling ready-mix concrete and aggregates to construction companies, so it's a less risky play since the company doesn't have to win contracts to benefit from massive infrastructure spending.Ultimately, these are just a couple of the sectors that were impacted significantly this week thanks to Trump's surprise victory. But we all need to remember that he doesn't take office until January, and we don't know for sure how quickly his policy changes will happen or how broad they will be.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than US Concrete Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.
