Fears persist "that a slowdown in China and a possible US rate hike will hurt economic growth and corporateprofitability," said Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets, in a note. European stocks and the early action for U.S. equities (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-futures-slip-with-fed-release-on-the-horizon-2015-08-19) have both been "plagued by the Chinese stock market meltdown," said Naeem Aslam,chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note. The Shanghai Composite on Wednesday dropped as much as 5% intraday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-stocks-resume-slide-leading-asian-shares-lower-2015-08-19) before turning higher toclose in positive territory. Miners on the Stoxx 600 were in the red, with Anglo American PLC (AAL.LN) down 4.4%, Swedish mining and smeltingcompany Boliden AB (BOL.SK) off 3.6% and Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) (RIO) (RIO) down 3.7%. "The selloff in commodities has been the main agenda on the trader's dashboard for some time," said Aslam. Copper "still cannot find its solid foundation as the selloff continues in the Chinese stock market. Unless we see some sign ofstabilization, it is extremely difficult to knit a scenario under which you could see...commodity prices rising again." The losses in mining shares weighed on the U.K.'sFTSE 100 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ftse-100-knocked-lower-as-china-concerns-persist-2015-08-19), helping it shed 1.9% of its value to close at 6,403.45. Greek gains: The Athex Composite shook off earlier losses and rose 0.3% to end at 675.33 as the German parliamentratified a EUR86 billion ($95 billion) bailout deal for cash-strapped Greece, although German Chancellor Angela Merkelfaced discord in her own conservative party.

The Fed: The eurozone's shared currency was buying $1.1062 versus $1.1025 late Tuesday in New York, slightly higherahead of the release of minutes from U.S. Federal Open Market Committee's meeting in July. Investors will look for anyinsight into the timing of the first interest-rate increase by the central bank since 2006. Since the Fed's July meeting "the markets have seen the devaluation of the yuan and further decline in energy prices -- two factors that may make it highly problematic for the Fed to proceed with normalization just yet," said BorisSchlossberg, managing director of FX strategy, in a note. "If the tone of the minutes suggests a sense of hesitation on the part of most FOMC members, the dollar could gethit," during afternoon trade in New York, "with USD/JPY likely testing the 1.2400 level while EUR/USD will try to popthe 1.1100 barrier," he said.

DAL on Monday lowered its performance estimates for the first half of 2017, and now its stock is down 3.41% to $48.40 per share through early afternoon trading. Stocks of other big U.S. airlines have also experienced some turbulence on the back of the Delta news, high oil prices , and fallout from President Donald Trump's travel ban.Southwest Airlines Co. LUV stock is down 2.36% to $57.46 per share in Monday trading. American Airlines Group, Inc. AAL stock is down 4.46% to $44.73 per share. United Continental Holdings, Inc. UAL stock is down 4.18% to $72.46 per share. And US Global Jets ETF JETS stock is down 2.08% to $28.71 per share.Delta's 8-K filing identified both lower unit revenue and higher costs as reasons for its lowered first half of 2017 expectations. The Atlanta-based airline predicted its Revenue per Available Seat Mile or unit revenue, which is calculated by dividing an airline's total revenue by its total available seat miles, will be flat in the first quarter of 2017. This came after Delta predicted in January its unit revenue would increase by 2%.Rising oil prices also contributed to Delta's lowered expectations. "Market fuel prices are tracking up about 55% for the quarter, which is expected to be the greatest year-on-year increase in 2017," the filing noted .This downturn comes only a few weeks after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A bought an eye-popping 43.2 million shares of Southwest Airlines in the fourth quarter.Berkshire's new position in the low-cost carrier is valued at $2.2 billion. Buffett's company also invested heavily in American Airlines, Delta and United, which signaled a shift in Buffett's decades-long stance that airlines were money-losers.Updated Travel BanTrump and the White House announced Monday morning an updated, less-drastic version of its travel ban. The new executive order removed Iraq from the list, leaving Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Iraq was removed after political pressure mounted, a great deal of which hung on the continuation of a joint U.S. and Iraqi effort to fight the Islamic State.The revamped executive order now exempts travelers holding valid visas or green cards as of Jan. 27, the date the initial ban went into effect. The new order also treats Syrian refugees, which were banned outright in the first order, the same as those from other countries.Trump's updated travel ban will not be put into action until March 16. The delay was implemented in order to address potential legal concerns.The new travel ban also comes after reports showed that the number of people visiting the U.S. from foreign countries has decreased significantly. New York City could see foreign travel decrease by over 2% in 2017, which would be the first drop in eight years. Other major U.S. cities have predicted a similar drop.A decrease in International travel could create $7.4 billion in lost revenue .Airline Update: More Economy FlightsUnited recently announced it will offer more domestic routes and budget-friendly flights . The airline will add summer flights from five of its hubs to 13 non-major cities. United will also increase flights on some existing routes and upgrade some seasonal routes into year-round options.United will add new flights from its biggest hub, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, to places such as Spokane, Wash. Airline hubs help save airlines money and offer passengers better routes to their selected destinations. The four major U.S. airlines all have nearly 10 different hubs.The added domestic routes came after United and American Airlines introduced brand new economy-class options . United and American Airlines plan to slowly roll out these new cheaper flights to most domestic destinations and eventually shorter trips to Latin America and the CaribbeanUnited and American Airlines made the move towards more economy-fares after Delta broke into the market last year. United plans to expand its new economy pricing beyond Minneapolis to its entire domestic roster, as the company fights to add more budget-minded consumers.The fight to offer more economical flights comes as low-cost airlines Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE and Frontier Airlines Inc. have gained traction. Southwest is still the most popular budget-friendly airline.8 Stocks with Huge Profit Potential                                                              Just released: Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

AUTO|F|2017-08-10 05:44:16|http://www.nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/dont-panic-about-the-big-july-auto-sales-declines-cm829916|Don t Panic About the Big July Auto Sales Declines|Don't Panic About the Big July Auto Sales DeclinesAugust 09, 2017, 09:45:00 PM EDT By Adam Levine-Weinberg, Motley FoolU.S. auto sales plunged year over year in July, and few major automakers were spared the carnage. Ford Motor (NYSE: F) reported a 7.5% decline in U.S. deliveries last month. Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU) posted an even bigger 10.5% decrease. Finally, deliveries plummeted 15.4% for market leader General Motors (NYSE: GM) .Not surprisingly, the big sales declines made many investors nervous about whether a new auto sales downturn is about to begin. It also aggravated existing worries about dealer inventories. Still, the month of July wasn't as bad for automakers as it may appear at first glance.You can't blame this one on rental carsU.S. auto sales probably reached their cyclical peak last year. As a result, it has been fairly common during 2017 for automakers to report year-over-year sales declines. However, they have often attributed these reversals to a deliberate strategy of reducing deliveries to rental car companies . (Sales to rental car companies tend to carry very low margins.)GM has reduced its sales to rental car companies recently. Image source: General Motors.All three U.S. automakers continued to dramatically reduce their daily rental deliveries last month. In fact, at General Motors, a negligible 1% of deliveries went to rental car companies during July.However, lower rental car deliveries weren't the only issue weighing down sales in July. GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler all reported lower retail sales as well. At Ford, the retail sales decline was a relatively modest 1%. By contrast, retail deliveries slumped 6% at Fiat Chrysler and dropped more than 14% at General Motors.Tough comparisonsAt first glance, the July sales results at the Detroit Three might seem to be cause for alarm -- especially the roughly 15% sales slide at General Motors. That said, automakers were facing tough comparisons, as July has been a particularly strong month for auto sales for the past couple of years.For example, General Motors reported a 14.1% jump in retail sales in July 2015. It followed that up with a 5% retail sales increase in July 2016. Thus, despite its double-digit retail sales decline last month, the General still delivered more cars to retail customers than it did in July 2014.Furthermore, from a high-level perspective, the situation does not look dire whatsoever. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for auto sales was a solid 16.7 million in July, compared to a SAAR of 17.8 million in July 2016. That was an unusually high level, as the U.S. auto market has never sustained a SAAR of 17.8 million for a whole year. (The full-year sales record, reached in 2016, is 17.55 million.)New vehicles are the key to future successAnother potential explanation for the weak recent sales trends is that automakers don't have the vehicles that American consumers want right now. Auto development cycles are long, and a few years ago it looked like $3-$4/gallon gas was here to stay. As a result, automakers invested in revamping their lineups of fuel-efficient cars.Instead, oil prices plunged, unlocking consumers' thirst for crossovers and SUVs, which tend to be larger and more comfortable. GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler are in the early phases of multiyear campaigns to update their existing crossover and SUV lineups, while introducing numerous additional models to cover every segment of the crossover/SUV market.The early signs are promising. General Motors' new and recently redesigned crossover models all posted strong sales gains last month, bucking the trend for the rest of the company.The redesigned Chevy Equinox sold quite well last month. Image source: General Motors.As automakers introduce new crossover and SUV models and update their existing portfolios, they may be able to get more people interested in upgrading their vehicles. Additionally, a further shift toward larger vehicles should boost average transaction prices and profit margins.Investors should certainly continue to monitor U.S. auto sales. If the SAAR starts to drop below 16 million, it would suggest that fears of a meaningful slowdown are coming to pass. But the July sales results themselves are not a cause for concern.10 stocks we like better than General Motors When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

AUTO|F|2016-11-13 08:53:37|http://www.nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-auto-investors-are-worried-about-the-united-states-cm708299|Why Auto Investors Are Worried About the United States|Why Auto Investors Are Worried About the United StatesNovember 12, 2016, 02:30:00 PM EDT By John Rosevear, Motley FoolShares of the Detroit automakers have had a tough ride in 2016. Year to date, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) shares are down almost 13%, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles '(NYSE: FCAU) are down nearly 17%.General Motors '(NYSE: GM) shares are about flat for the year, but only because a sharp rally on Thursday and Friday erased its losses. Through this past Wednesday, GM's stock was down about 9% since the beginning of 2016.It doesn't seem fair. All three have reported strong profits in recent quarters. But investors have been worried about the U.S. new-car market, which accounts for the bulk of Detroit's profits -- and which is showing signs of slowing down.Strong truck and SUV sales have generated fat profits for Detroit over the last few years. Image source: Ford Motor Company.North America is extremely important to Detroit's bottom linesGM, Ford, and FCA are all global companies with huge operations around the world. But all three, more so than most of their global rivals, are still very dependent on profits in North America, most of which come from the United States.Data sources: the automakers' earnings reports. Chart shows adjusted pre-tax profits in North America (blue) as a percentage of overall pre-tax profits (blue plus green) for 2016 through Sept. 30. FCA's results have been converted from euros to U.S. dollars at a rate of 1 euro = $1.09.That makes the state of the U.S. new-car market very important to investors in the Detroit automakers. And as I said, there are growing signs that it may be past its cyclical peak.As U.S. sales go, so do Detroit's profitsAuto sales are cyclical. Demand for new cars and trucks is closely correlated with consumer confidence, for reasons that are probably obvious: People and businesses hold off on buying new vehicles when they're concerned that their earnings are going to be squeezed.The pace of auto sales is tracked using a calculated statistic called the "SAAR," for "seasonally adjusted annualized rate." If we say that the SAAR for October 2016 was 17.65 million, it means that if the pace of auto sales we saw in October were maintained for a full calendar year, 17.65 million vehicles would be sold that year.There are several different calculations of SAAR. The most important one for our purposes is the one that shows the pace of U.S. sales of "light vehicles," meaning cars, pickups, and SUVs. This chart shows the SAAR for the past three years.The pace of sales can vary considerably from month to month, but the trend isn't too hard to see: While it's still very strong by historical standards, the pace of light-vehicle sales in the U.S. peaked late in 2015 and has fallen off since.This longer-term chart, showing mostly SAAR figures all the way back to the beginning of 2000, might make the picture more clear.U.S. light-vehicle sales plateaued from 2000 through 2006, fell off a cliff in 2008, and didn't really recover to pre-recession levels until 2014. They went a little higher in 2015 and have slipped back a bit in 2016.What does it mean if the auto sales cycle is past its peak?As last decade's data shows, if the economy is reasonably strong, auto sales can stay at a plateau for several years. That might be how things play out this time. But there are signs that automakers are starting to scrounge for sales growth by boosting their incentives. That's not an encouraging sign for investors, as rising incentives tend to eat into profit margins.There are other signs. Just in the past few weeks, both Ford and GM have announced production cuts . They were modest ones, but production cuts of any kind aren't something we'd expect to see in a growing market.For long-term investors, there's no reason to panic: A cyclical sales decline is normal and inevitable. But it's worth keeping in mind that as sales in North America taper off, profits at the Detroit automakers are likely to come under pressure for a while.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Ford Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

AUTO|F|2015-07-31 20:47:31|http://www.nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/earnings-review-record-profits-in-north-america-boost-fords-spirits-cm503935|Earnings Review: Record Profits In North America Boost Ford's Spirits|SubscribeFord Motors F) announced earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 onTuesday, July 28. The numbers were encouraging : the company's netincome stood at $1.89 billion, up $571 million compared to a yearago. The revenue for the quarter stood at $35.1 billion, a declineof $250 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2014.While the company lost money in Europe and South America, itreported record profits in North America ($2.6 billion), on theback of higher average transaction prices and strong sales acrossthe product portfolio.We have a$15  price estimate for Ford, which is inline with the current market price. We are in theprocess of revising our estimates in order to incorporate thelatest earnings. High North America Profitability For the full year, Ford was targeting an operating margin in thehigher end of the 8.5-9.5% range in North America. However, Fordhas already achieved an operating margin of 9.1% for the first halfof the fiscal year 2015. With an expected increase in F-150production of close to 20%, this margin should be expected to goeven higher as the F-150 is one of the most profitable vehicles forthe company and has been commanding higher than usual transactionprices throughout the year. This might change somewhat as Ford hasbeen restricting sales to commercial buyers, who tend to buy unitsat slightly lower prices than retail buyers. They generally preferthe higher-trim units which command higher margins.[trefis_forecast ticker="F" driver="0103″North America is not only the most profitable region for thecompany but also its most critical region, as when profits theresuffer, the company's overall profitability tends to suffer,too.  In the first quarter, profitability in the region wasweighed down by the low supply of the company's best selling F-150pick-up trucks.  Ford undertook a refresh of the F-150, whichearlier used to be made from a steel body.  But the companyclosed down production at the two plants where it is manufactured -Dearborn (Michigan) and Kansas City - to allow for their retooling,so that the trucks could be manufactured with aluminum bodies. Theplants only reached full capacity toward the end of the quarterand, as a result, dealerships were running with lower inventorythan usual. On account of the low inventory, the company focused onselling most of it to retail buyers, who tend to prefer higher-trimtrucks that generate higher margins, as opposed to commercialbuyers, who tend to buy hundreds of units at at a time with aslight discount. As a result, the company has lost out on marketshare in the commercial sales segment to GM, generating strongsales for its Chevrolet Silverado.Europe ImprovesFord's total market share in the twenty biggest markets inEurope for the first half of the fiscal year increased on the backperformance of the newly introduced line of compact vehicles. Fordwas also the leading commercial brand in Europe in the firstquarter. The automaker is still trying to achieve an optimal saleschannel mix for the region, with a special focus on achieving ahigher share of the fleet segment.Ford aims to introduce a total of 25 new or refreshed models inEurope over the next five years.  Going forward, the companyexpects the impact of a more stable automotive market and new modelintroductions to be offset by uncertainty surrounding Russia andhigher pension expenses.  As a result, Ford expects itsoperating losses in the region to be  $250 million in2015.China SlowdownWhile Ford's profitability in the quarter was boostedsignificantly by the rise in equity income from its joint venturesin China, its performance in the second half of the fiscal year inChina will likely be less favorable. Ford's profitability in theregion was mostly driven by lower costs and a favorable exchangerate. In the first six months of the year, Ford sold close to543,500 units in China, roughly the same as the number from a yearago. For the full year, Ford sold 1.1 million units in 2014. In2015, Ford expects to launch 15 new models in the region, includingthe luxury car Lincoln Continental. The recent stock market crashand slowdown in economic growth will affect the overall market andthis was reflected in Ford downgrading its forecast of total unitssold in China from a range of 24.5 million to 26.5 million to arange of  23 million to 24 million.
